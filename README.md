# Animals
This program allows you to track the animals in the zoo. This system contains the Animal class, which has its id, which represents the code under which the animal is kept in the database, and the name, which represents the name of the animal. If an empty name or id is passed to the constructor or setter, an IllegalArgumentException with the text "Name cannot be empty" or "Id cannot be empty" should be thrown. The Dog and Cat classes are inherited from the Animal class. The Wolf, DomesticDog classes are inherited from the Dog class, while the Lion, Tiger, DomesticCat classes are inherited from the Cat class.
